# DELTAH'S BRI'ISH TRANSLATOR

## *DBT will only work reliably on Windows machines.*

Please follow the instructions below before using your copy of deltah's bri'ish translator.
1. [Download the latest version of Python](www.python.org/downloads).
2. Thanks to updates, you shouldn't have to manually install anything! As long as Python is installed, DBT should work straight out of the box.
3. Run the master.py file by double-clicking it, or by right-clicking and pressing 'run' or 'open'.
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal that should pop up.

Report any bugs or suggestions to @deltah#0404 or @SPITFIRE#4609

Feel free to add or change any settings in the config.json file, make changes to the code and request to edit!
Please don't redistribute any original version as your own because it'll make me big sad :(

#### If DBT suddenly closes suddenly and you're running Windows, please report it. This is because there is an error in the code which can be fixed once it's known about. If you are **not** using Windows, there isn't much that can be done because DBT was developed for Windows and not any other OS. Feel free to fork this repo and develop your own version for other OS's though.
